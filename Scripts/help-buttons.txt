Sinden Autostart Buttons Options Help
-----------------------------

The Sinden software maps a mouse/keyboard input to each of its buttons. Assign what input event applies to each button here.

Editing the button mapping may lead to loss of functions in games if they have been pre-configured with the existing settings in mind. Proceed only if you have made backups of your configs and you know what you are doing."
