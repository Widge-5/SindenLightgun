Sinden Autostart Recoil Options Help
-----------------------------

The Sinden Lightgun has three recoil modes: Single (firing the solenoid once per event), Auto (repeated firing throughout the duration of an event) and Off (no recoil).

Rapid firing at high strength and frequency levels can deplete the capacitor faster than it can recharge. You can make adjustments here to mitigate against that.

Single Recoil Strength
- Recoil strength 0-100 (non-linear scale). 100 is max. Higher values will deplete the capacitor quickly.

Auto Recoil Strength
- Strength of the automatic (machine gun) recoil, 80 is strong 40 is medium. Higher values will deplete the capacitor quickly.

Auto Start Delay
- In Auto mode, sets a timed delay after the first pulse before the repeated  pulses begin.  Can act as a "mixed-mode" between single shot and automatic if you set the delay at the right value. Higher values increase the duration of the delay. 0 is no delay.

Auto Pulse Delay
- Time between each firing of the solenoid for Auto recoil. Higher values are less frequent but can help reduce power loss.
